This software/hardware project provides head tracking for use in some PC games.

The project uses Nordic Semiconductor's nRF24LE1 and nRF24LU1+ chips for wireless communication and USB, and does the head tracking using the Invensense MPU6050 gyro accelerometer.

The project is based in the ED Tracker (http://edtracker.org.uk/) project which implements head tracking through the Arduino platform.
